                <p>Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham.  They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.</p>

                <p>As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.</p>

                <p>The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.  He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his battery--No. 12, of the Horse Artillery.  My plan was to return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go with her out of the country forthwith.  For I already perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.</p>
